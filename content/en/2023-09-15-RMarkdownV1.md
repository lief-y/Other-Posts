[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free, easy-to-use tool to collect, organize, cite, and share research sources. It's the best of all tools that I have ever used to manage personal research library.

## Some Awesome Features

- Items in Zotero libraries can be organized with [collections and tags](https://www.zotero.org/support/collections_and_tags).
  
- [Zotero's sync functionality](https://www.zotero.org/support/sync) allows you to access your Zotero library on any computer with internet access. Zotero syncing has two parts: data syncing and file syncing. Zotero file sync works with WebDAV servers, for example, [Iianguyun](https://www.jianguoyun.com/s/pricing). If you read Chinese, a guide on setting up the WebDAV server with Jianguoyun can be found here <https://help.jianguoyun.com/?p=3168>.
  
- Zotero [detects duplicates](https://www.zotero.org/support/duplicate_detection) and allows merging duplicates.
  
- The [Zotero Connector browser extensions](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) allow you to add items to your Zotero library with the click of a button in a browser such as Firefox, Chrome, Edge, or Safari.

## Some Awesome Add-ons

  Manage all your Tags in one Zotero add-on.

    - Automatically add /unread tag for new items and remove /unread after read
    - Support batch processing with tags
    - Manage tags with custom rules

For example, with `number_sections: true`, the following slides that contains the unicode character ùë¶ (U+1D4A7) with cause the rendering fall

```markdown
## Slide Title

A unicode letter in the slide may fail the rendering to html file.
